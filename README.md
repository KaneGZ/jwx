# github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx 

In March 28, 2022 this project changed default branch structure to release branches `v1`, `v2`, etc.
and development branches `develop/v1`, `develop/v2`, etc. The branch that you are currently viewing
is no longer being used.

This branch exists because there are automated tools out there that rely on it.
It WILL NOT receive updates, and it will be phased out sometime during 2022.

If your tool still rely on this branch, please make the necessary change accordingly.
